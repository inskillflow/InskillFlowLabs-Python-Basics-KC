## What You've Learned

### Variables & Assignment
- How to create and name variables
- Best practices for variable names
- Using comments to document code

### Data Types
- **Strings** (text)
- **Integers** (whole numbers)
- **Floats** (decimals)
- **Booleans** (True/False)
- How to check types with `type()`

### User Input
- Getting input with `input()`
- Converting strings to numbers with `int()` and `float()`
- Creating interactive programs
- Using f-strings for formatting

---

## Sample Solution

Here's one way to solve the challenge:

```python
# Student Information System
print("=== Student Registration System ===\n")

# Get student information
name = input("Enter your full name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
gpa = float(input("Enter your GPA (0.0-4.0): "))

# Calculate graduation year
current_year = 2025
graduation_year = current_year + 4

# Display the information
print("\n=== Student Profile ===")
print(f"Name: {name}")
print(f"Age: {age} years old")
print(f"GPA: {gpa:.2f}")
print(f"Expected Graduation: {graduation_year}")
print(f"\nGood luck with your studies, {name}!")
```

## Key Concepts to Remember

1. **Variables are containers** - They store data for later use
2. **Data types matter** - Strings vs. numbers behave differently
3. **input() returns strings** - Always convert when you need numbers
4. **Comments are essential** - Future you will appreciate them!

## Practice Makes Perfect

Before moving to Week 2, try these practice exercises:

### Exercise 1: Temperature Converter
Create a program that:
- Asks for temperature in Celsius
- Converts to Fahrenheit: `F = (C * 9/5) + 32`
- Displays both temperatures

### Exercise 2: Shopping Calculator
Create a program that:
- Asks for item name and price
- Asks for quantity
- Calculates total cost
- Displays a receipt

### Exercise 3: Age Calculator
Create a program that:
- Asks for birth year
- Calculates current age
- Calculates age in 10 years
- Calculates age in dog years (age Ã— 7)

## What's Next?

### Python Week 2: Conditional Statements
Next week you'll learn:
- If statements
- Elif and else
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Nested conditions

With conditions, your programs will make decisions!
