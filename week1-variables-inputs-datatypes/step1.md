# Step 1: Variables and Assignment

## What are Variables?

Variables are containers that store data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put information and retrieve it later.

## Creating Variables

In Python, you create a variable by assigning a value to a name:

```python
variable_name = value
```

### Important Rules:
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores
- Must start with a letter or underscore (not a number)
- Case-sensitive (`myVar` and `myvar` are different)
- Use descriptive names!

## Your First Variable

Let's create your first Python program!

**Step 1:** Open the editor  
`script.py`{{open}}

**Step 2:** Copy this code into the editor:

```python
# This is a comment
# Python will not run this line
# Use comments so you remember what the code does

myCardPin = 1234

print(myCardPin)
```

**Step 3:** Run your code!  
`python3 script.py`{{execute}}

You should see `1234` printed in the terminal below!

## Try It Yourself!

Now modify your code to:
1. Create a variable called `myName` with your name (in quotes: `"YourName"`)
2. Print your name using `print(myName)`
3. Run the code again!

**Hint:** Text values need quotes, numbers don't.

## Understanding the Code

- `#` creates a comment (Python ignores these)
- `myCardPin = 1234` creates a variable and stores the number 1234
- `print()` displays the value on screen

**Pro Tip:** Always use comments to explain your code. Your future self will thank you!
